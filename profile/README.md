Our work draws from demographic, clinical, behavioural, social, and health outcomes information. From these sources, we gain a comprehensive perspective 
on population health, allowing us to inform decision-making related to improved health system performance, reduced inequities, and fiscal sustainability.

Most importantly, we work directly with key health system decision makers, which maximizes the meaningfulness of our studies, and enhances their real-world
impact.

The Population Health Analytics Laboratory is based at the University of Toronto’s [Dalla Lana School of Public Health](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/about/) — the largest public health school in Canada 🇨🇦, with more than 800 faculty, 850 students, and research and training partnerships with institutions throughout Toronto and the world. With $34.4 million in research funding per year, the School supports discovery in global health, tobacco impacts on health, occupational disease and disability, air pollution, inner city and Indigenous health, among many other areas.
